## Introduction

Shion is a time tracking software used to record specific situations that occur during a certain time period. You can manually record what is happening, or have the ship automatically monitor the activity of specific software. Of course, it's not just a simple record of the start and end times, but you can also add text, pictures, and videos like writing a diary

Each data item provides grouping, and you can package the related data together to present them in a clear and organized manner in charts and timelines. Customize your overview interface with multiple charts, so you can have a clearer understanding of the passage of time ⌛
